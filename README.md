# Deribit Data Collector

Collects data from Deribit (the leading crypto options exchange).

Pulls all available instruments for BTC and ETH (all strikes and expiries), includes current pricing and full order book.

Runs on Serverless for easy deployment to AWS lambda, storing data in DynamoDB.


## Usage

### Configuration

Update handler.py and serverless.yml with the appropriate DynamoDB ids, serverless will automatically deal with IAM roles and permissions.

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-python-scheduled-cron-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-python-scheduled-cron-project-dev (205s)

functions:
  rateHandler: aws-python-scheduled-cron-project-dev-rateHandler (2.9 kB)
  cronHandler: aws-python-scheduled-cron-project-dev-cronHandler (2.9 kB)
```

There is no additional step required. Your defined schedules becomes active right away after deployment.

### Local invocation

In order to test out your functions locally, you can invoke them with the following command:

```
serverless invoke local --function rateHandler
```

After invocation, you should see output similar to:

```bash
INFO:handler:Your cron function aws-python-scheduled-cron-dev-rateHandler ran at 15:02:43.203145
```
